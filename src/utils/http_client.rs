// hypothetical here: the playback-session close/sync calls run inside the spawned
// playback task, and `wait_prev_session_finished` blocks every future play attempt until
// that task signals it finished - so one hung request could wedge playback with no way
// out but restarting the app (see known_bugs.md `bug_id: bf10cd`). Same idea as the read
// timeout on the VLC RC socket in `vlc_tcp_stream.rs`.

// Generous enough not to abort a legitimately slow-but-working request (measured
// round-trips against a real server sit around 1-2s, so this is ~30x headroom, and a
// prematurely cancelled progress sync would lose real listening position) while still
// guaranteeing every call eventually returns instead of hanging forever.
