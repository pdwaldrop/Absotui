// one is still tearing down. Returns whether the slot was actually claimed - `false`
// means the caller must NOT proceed to start a track (see below).
//
// Callers deliberately do NOT follow this with a defensive close of whatever's left in
// `listening_session`. Every normal exit path (Q, natural end-of-track, VLC-quit
// detection) closes its own session before returning, so the only way that row can be
// stale-and-never-closed is an abnormal exit (crash/kill) - and `main.rs` now closes
// that case once at startup instead. Running it here as well closed the session twice
// on every track switch (confirmed live 2026-07-28: once from the previous track's own
// quit-detection loop, once from the caller) - the concrete root cause behind bug_id
// dd9a649.
